Final Project Ideas
===================

1. machine learning &rarr; nn?
2. specif. genetic algorithms
2. BrainF* interpereter (pure functional, for challenge)
3. algorithms and data structures (the subset that can be well represented functionally)
4. linter
5. game solvers
	- boggle
	- sudoku
6. job application challenge solutions, functionally
7. haskell vs. scala vs. clojure vs. ocaml for specific, smaller tasks
